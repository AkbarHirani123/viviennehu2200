Before her fashion endeavors she had a business academic background, which include a Bachlor's degree in Finance from University of Hohenheim in Germany and a master's degree in Business and Economics from SUNY of US.&amp;nbsp; She has worked in the Investment Banking industry in New York for more than 3 years. Her decision to change career paths stems from her zeal for fashion and her love of all things creative. Vivienne Hu established her brand and debuted her first Spring\/Summer collection in 2012, after a fashion degree from Parsons The New School for Design and an accumulation of industry experience at Oscar de la Renta and Yigal Azrouel. With the initial market success of the first few seasons she formally launched her first flagship store in Soho, New York in 2013.&amp;nbsp; Since then Vivienne Hu has steadily built up her customer base and gained the media attention with her truly unique and trendy designs. Her collections exhibits an amazing blend of classic European elegance, New York downtown style and a touch of exotic Asian taste, and the design concepts cater especially to professional women who have a strong sense of self-independence and a desire for displaying their femininity and personality in a unique way. &amp;nbsp;Since the summer of 2012, Vivienne Hu has been hosting her &amp;nbsp;fashion runway show every year. She has also served various industrial duties at request, for example the juror duty for Parsons Graduate Thesis Work Review. With the increasing attention she has drawn, she has &amp;nbsp;been requested to dress a number of celebrities for red carpet events and her designs have been featured in various media and magazines like Bazaar and Elegant. In addition to her couture and ready-to-wear lines, Vivienne also designs customized gowns for her celebrity clientele and her New York based customers.&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;\/table&gt;\r\n&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;807&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;tbody&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;tr&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;td valign=&quot;top&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;td&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http:\/\/www.viviennehu.com\/shop\/image\/catalog\/categories\/designer_s.jpg&quot; style=&quot;width: 480px; height: 720px;&quot; \/&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/td&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;\/tr&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/tbody&gt;\r\n&lt;\/table&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n","meta_title":"About Us","meta_description":"","meta_keyword":""},{"information_id":"3","bottom":"1","sort_order":"3","status":"1","language_id":"1","title":"Return Policy","description":"&lt;h2&gt;\r\n\t&amp;nbsp;&lt;\/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;p&gt;\r\n\t\tThank you for ordering from viviennehu.com.
